### `Description`

Welcome to Project 05 of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, students are tasked with converting a well intended (but rather poorly implemented) static webpage created for local restaurant reviews to a mobile-ready web application.  During 'Stage One' of development, students begin with a static design that lacks accessibility with the overall goals being to convert the web application to be fully responsive on different sized displays and make it accessible for screen reader use as well. Students will also begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching assets for offline use using the Cache API and a ServiceWorker.

### `Instructions`

To run the project:
- Clone (or download) the .zip project files folder to your local desktop.
- Launch a local client server from the terminal (within the project directory):  
Example (using Python): `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`  
- Open your favorite web browser and visit: `http://localhost:8000`
